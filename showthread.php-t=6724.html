--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Here are the answers &amp; explanations for 51-100 Math JJ. Please verify &amp; confirm them. <br />
<br />
<br />
51) How many integers from 0 to 50, inclusive, have a remainder of 1 when divided by 3? <br />
A) 15<br />
B) 16<br />
C) 17<br />
D) 18<br />
E) 19<br />
<br />
<br />
Solution<br />
<br />
since the problem tests the y=xq + r concept, we have:<br />
<br />
y=3q +1, where 3 is the divisor and 1 is the remainder. now for this to become true, 3 cannot be a divisor of y. y will be 1 greater than it would be if 3 would be a divisor of y. so i started with 4, next one 7 etc. to save calculation time, i set up an equality:<br />
<br />
0 &lt;= 3q + 1 &lt;= 50<br />
<br />
solve for q and you get 16.3. but that's not in the answer choice. one might tend to pick 16, however, the y=xq+r concept says that when you divide a smaller number by a greater number, the quotient q is zero and what's left is the remainder. so the only other number we didn't account for yet is the number 1. so we have: <br />
<br />
1=3q+1, which becomes 1=3(0)+1. so what's left is the remainder 1. thus the answer is 17, not 16. ; C<br />
<br />
<br />
52) A straight line in the xy-plane has a slope of 2 and a y-intercept of 2. On this line, what is the x-coordinate of the point whose y-coordinate is 500 ?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
A. 249<br />
<br />
B. 498<br />
<br />
C. 676<br />
<br />
D. 823<br />
<br />
E. 1,002<br />
<br />
Solution<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Equation can be written in the form y=mx+c, where M=slope and c is y intercept.<br />
substituting the given values 500 = 2x+2 =&gt; 448 = 2x =&gt; x = 249; A<br />

53. A gardener is going to plant 2 red rosebushes and 2 white rosebushes. If the gardener is to select each of the bushes at random, one at a time, and plant them in a row, what is the probability that the 2 rosebushes in the middle of the row will be the red rosebushes? <br />
A. 1/12 <br />
B. 1/6 <br />
C. 1/5 <br />
D. 1/3 <br />
E. ½<br />
<br />
Solution<br />
<br />
If you want to apply combination formula total number of ways in which you can arrange 4 things with 2 of each type= 4!/2!*2! = 6<br />
<br />
General formula is: n!/(a!*b!*c!..) where a, b and c.. are the number of objects which are of the same kind.<br />
<br />
the number of combination when 2 Rosebushes are together in the middle = 1 , there for P=1/6 ; B<br />
<br />
Its very easy to visualize if u draw four boxes. <br />

54.If (10^50) -74 is written as an integer in base 10 notation , what is the sum of the digits in that integer? <br />
<br />
Solution<br />
<br />
10^n-74 = 9999...9926 (the number of 9 is n-2)<br />
<br />
there fore n=50 : 9 * 48 = 432<br />
<br />
432 +2+6 = 440<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
55.If A and C are integers, is A&gt;0? <br />
(1) A+C&gt;50 <br />
(2) C&gt;48<br />
<br />
Solution<br />
<br />
Stmt 1 : A can hold a negative/positive value, <br />
e.g A = -1; C= 52; =&gt; A+C = 51<br />
e.g A = 4 C= 47 =&gt; A+C = 51<br />
<br />
Stmt 2 : Using C value alone without any relation between A/C, A value cannot be determined<br />
<br />
Stmt 1&amp; 2 =&gt; A can hold a negative/positive value, <br />
e.g A = -1; C= 52; =&gt; A+C = 51<br />
e.g A = 4 C= 49 =&gt; A+C = 53<br />

A certain quantity is measured on two different scales, the R-scale and the S-scale, that are related linearly. Measurements on the R-scale of 6 and 24 correspond to measurements on the S-scale of 30 and 60, respectively. What measurement on the R-scale corresponds to a measurement of 100 on the S-scale?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
A. 20<br />
<br />
B. 36<br />
<br />
C. 48<br />
<br />
D. 60<br />
<br />
E. 84<br />
<br />
Solution<br />
<br />
Assume y = ax + b (y=s scale, x = r scale)<br />
<br />
30 = 6a + b<br />
<br />
60 = 24a + b<br />
<br />
Solving these 2 eqns =&gt;b=20 and a = 10/6<br />
<br />
100 = (10/6)* x + 20<br />
<br />
x=48; C<br />

57. A certain characteristic in a large population has a distribution that is symmetric about the mean M. If 68 percent of the distribution lies within one standard deviation D of the mean, what percent of the distribution is less than M+D? <br />
<br />
A. 16% <br />
B. 32% <br />
C. 48% <br />
D. 84% <br />
E. 92% <br />
<br />
Solution<br />
<br />
Basically - they tell you that between M-D and M+D there is 68% of the population, therefore, 2*D=68%, or D=34%.<br />
<br />
that been said, less then M - 50 %<br />
<br />
----&gt; Less then M+D = 50% + 34% = 84% - answer is D.<br />

58. Is the integer N odd? <br />
(1) N is divisible by 3 <br />
(2)2N is divisible by twice as many positive integer as N. <br />
<br />
Solution<br />
<br />
Stmt 1 :Mutiples of 3 : 3, 6, 9…..; Both even/ odd numbers are divided by 3; =&gt; A is not enough<br />
Stmt 2 : Only odd numbers multipled by 2 will have twice the factors as that of the odd number; e.g 3 = 3,1; 6= 6,3,2,1; 9=9,3,1;18=18,9,6,3,2,1<br />

59. In a circle, QS and RT all are diameters, also mutually perpendicular, the QR arc length is 8√2, What is the area of the circle <br />
<br />
A. 256∏<br />
B. 256/∏<br />
C. 512/∏<br />
D. 512/∏<br />
E. 512∏<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Solution<br />
<br />
<br />
The length of an arc is given by (x/360) * 2 * pi * r where x is the measure of the angle. We know x is 90.<br />
<br />
90/360 * 2 * pi * r = 8√2 =&gt; Pi/2*r = 8√2 <br />
<br />
r = 16√2/Pi<br />
therefore area = 16√2/Pi * 16√2/Pi * Pi =&gt;512/Pi; D<br />

60. Six cards numbered from 1 to 6 are placed in an empty bowl. First one card is drawn and then put back into the bowl; then a second card is drawn. If the cards are drawn at random and if the sum of the numbers on the cards is 8, what is the probability that one of the two cards drawn is numbered 5? <br />
<br />
A. 1/6 <br />
B. 1/5 <br />
C. 1/3 <br />
D. 2/5 <br />
E. 2/3 <br />
<br />
Solution<br />
<br />
Possible ways to get sum 8 are (3,5),(5,3),(4,4),(2,6),(6,2) i.e 5<br />
<br />
Out of these ways in which 1 card is 5 are 2 --&gt; (3,5),(5,3)<br />
<br />
probability = 2/5 ; D<br />

61. m, n are positive integers, r is remainder, what is r of (5*10^n + m) /3? <br />
1) m =1; <br />
2) n = 10<br />
<br />
Solution<br />
<br />
Stmt 1: 10 to any power always starts with 1 and will end with 0’s. When that number is multipled by 5, 1 will be replaced by 5. the sum of the digits in that number will be 5. When m = 1 is added the sum of the digits will be 6; there for the reminder when devided by 3 will be 0; <br />
e.g : assuming n = 4 ; 10 = 10000; 5*10000= 50000; 50000+1 =50001; 50001 is devisible by 3;<br />
<br />
Stmt 2 : as mentioned above value of n doesn’t matter;<br />
<br />
There fore A<br />
<br />
<br />
62. What is remainder if the number N is divided by 12? <br />
1. Remainder is 1 if the number is divided by 6<br />
2. Remainder is &gt;6 if the number is divided by 12<br />
<br />
Solution<br />
<br />
Stmt 1: N = 6k+1; N can be 7,13,19; When N is devided by 12, the reminders are 7,1,7… stmt alone is not enough<br />
Stmt 2 : N = 12K+R, where R &gt; 6; R cannot be determined<br />
<br />
Stmt 1 &amp; 2 : 6k+1; N can be 7,13,19; When N is devided by 12, the reminders are 7,1,7, when Stmt 2 is applied reminder cannot be 1; thr fore reminder is 7;<br />

63. Is the tallest man of A group is taller than tallest man of B group?<br />
(1): The shortest man of A group is shorter than tallest man of B group <br />
(2) A group people heights RANGE is bigger than B group <br />
<br />
Solution<br />
<br />
Statement 1 of course is not enough since it tells us nothing about the height of the tallest man.<br />
<br />
Statement 2 although seeming right at first sight, doesn't actually tells us if the groups overlap, contain in each etc.<br />
<br />
Even when taking both statements we still cannot determine. We don't know if group be is contained in the range of group A. Let's take for example the following situation: the tallest men of groups A and B are of the same height, but the shortest of group A is shorter than the shortest of group B. It abides with both statements. Therefore, E. <br />
<br />
It's E.<br />
<br />
<br />
64. If n is an integer greater than 6, which of the following must be divisible by 3? <br />
<br />
A) n(n+1) (n-4) <br />
<br />
B) n(n+2) (n-1) <br />
<br />
C) n(n+3) (n-5) <br />
<br />
D) n(n+4) (n-2) <br />
<br />
E) n(n+5) (n-6) <br />
<br />
Solution<br />
<br />
B fails for n = 8 =&gt; 8*10*7<br />
C fails for n = 7 =&gt; 7*10*2<br />
D fails for n = 7 =&gt; 7*11*5<br />
E fails for n = 8 =&gt; 8*13*2<br />

65. The ratio of the number of women to the number of men to the number of children in a room is 5:2:7, respectively. What is the total number of people in the room? <br />
(1) The total number of women and children in the room is 12. <br />
(2) There are fewer than 4 men in the room. <br />
<br />
Solution`<br />
<br />
W:M:C :: 5:2:7 =&gt; W:M:C :: 5K:2K:7K;<br />
<br />
Stmt 1 : 5K+7K = 12 =&gt; K = 1; total strength =&gt; 5K+2K+7K = 14K = 14;<br />
Stmt 2 : 2K = 3 or 2 or 1 =&gt; <br />
K cannot be 3/2 as 5K will be 5*3/2 =&gt; women should be a +ve interger;<br />
K cannot be 1/2 as 5K will be 5*1/2 =&gt; women should be a +ve interger;<br />
=&gt; 2K = 2; K = 1 ; total strength =&gt; 5K+2K+7K = 14K = 14;<br />

1) Every number in S is an integer. <br />
2) Every number in S is positive. <br />
<br />
Solution`<br />
<br />
Stmt 1 : every integer range : -∞ to ∞; There for -∞ is the smallest; Pls CONFIRM<br />
Stmt 2 : Positive number range : 1 to ∞; there for there should be a smallest number;<br />

67. All the employees donate for the charity concert held in the city. 1/4 of the employees contributes below 200, 2/3 of the employees contribute 200 to 1,000, The rest contribute above 1000. Mean value of contributions greater than 200 is 360 dollar . What is the mean value of contributions greater than 1,000? <br />
(1) Mean value of contributions less than 200 is 180 <br />
(2) Mean value of contributions between 200~1000 is 540<br />
<br />
Solution`<br />
<br />
X employees ; 1- 1/4 - 2/3 = 12/12 - 3/12 - 8/12 = 1/12<br />
<br />
X/12 of people donated above 1000<br />
<br />
1/4 * 180 + 2/3 * 540 + 1/12 * X = 360<br />
<br />
so we can get X, and we can compare X with 1000.<br />
<br />
Therefore, answer to this question would be C<br />

71. From May 1 to May 30 in the same year, the balance in a checking account increased. What was the balance in the checking account on May 30? <br />
<br />
1) If, during this period of time, the increase in the balance in the checking account had been 12 percent, then the balance in the account on May 30 would have been $504 <br />
<br />
2) During this period of time, the increase in the balance in the checking account was 8 percent. <br />
<br />
Solution<br />
<br />
<br />
Stmt 1 : Given amount on may 30 and the increase from may 1st; Using this statement balance on May 1 can be calculated; i.e X+X*12/100 = 504; But the given percent is assumption and therefore the balance on 30 cannot be calculated; Stmt 1 alone is not enough<br />
Stmt 2 : The actual percent increase is given; But the initial value on May 1 st is not known; Therefore Stmt 2 alone is not enough<br />
<br />
<br />
